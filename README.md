# OpenTimelineIO drp adapter plugin

This repository aims at storing an adapter for the OpenTimelineIO project allowing to import .drp files from the Blackmagic ATEM ISO. The initial goal is to be able to import them directly in KDEnlive.

It works as is, for simple file based sources, and the .drp file generated by the ATEM ISO. Do not expect to work it right away for every use-case, and obviously not for an actual DaVinci Resolve generated file.

## Tests

There is a a basic .drp file in sample_data/ that is parsed during the tests. It can be tried using:
```bash
# In the root folder of the repo
pip install -e .

# Test an adapter for instance
otioconvert -i some_timeline.drp -o some_timeline.ext
```
